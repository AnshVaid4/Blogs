### Why Cybersecurity?
In the current scenario, where everything has shifted to internet, so is the crime that has also upgraded itself to <br>
the cyberspace. Data is so cheap nowadays that each and every person has the access of internet easily. Therefore, a
common person has all his contact numbers, photos, videos, important documents, notes, playlists, reminders etc. as 
a backup on the internet. Somehow if the device gets compromized then this "backup" can be missused in several ways
depending on the attacker.
Huge amount of data is present in _cyberspace_ and also being added every hour. Have an idea with the following fact
that what happens across the word in 60 seconds

Apart from above discussion, there are many other platforms on internet where people show their activity time to time.
Some of the data is confidential and some is open source. The Confidential data acts as the hack value, i.e. the hackers
are in need of such information that is not accessible by the unauthorized users and expect some ransom in return or 
else they make it public, or missuse it to defame the owner of the information, which is a crime.
This brings the need of cybersecurity. This whole field deals with the various steps used by the cybersecurity personnel
in order to keep the cyberspace safe for the general public, to prevent the data from being accessed by unethical people,
and if it's done then take the legal procedings against the attacker and fix the damages done by the attacker.

### Need of Ethical Hackers
The ethical hackers are the personnel who do hacking within the legal boundaries and don't have intentions to harm anyone.
They help the organization by finding various vulnerabilities in their applications, websites and server; so that no one 
could exploit any of those vulnerabilities and get control over the server or harm the organization in any other way.
For dealing with hackers the ethical hacker have to think like a black hat hackers(the attackers) and get into the server
by exploiting the vulnerabilities they found. Later they patch those vulnerabilities, discovered by them so that the 
organization remains safe from any attacks. In general the hacking is done by performing following steps:

1. **Footprinting**
2. **Scanning**
3. **Enumeration**
4. **Gaining access into system**
5. **Maintaining that access**
6. **Clearing logs**

A cybersecurity enthusiast and an ethical hacker knows a lot more than above six points. It's not like if you have got
command somehow on these six points then you have mastered cybersecurity and have become an ethical hacker. The ethical
hacker and a cybersecurity personnel have to keep himself updated regarding the latest bug found, the latest case studies
related to any cyber crime, and also has the knowledge in the networking field. Linux is mandatory if you want to become 
an ethical hacker. There are over 1000 commands in linux and each commannd has several options. It's impossible to mugup 
the commands in linux, rather you should have a hands-on practice with most of the commands. Afterall it's all about practicing
things. In networking you should have the knowledge of atleast subnetting, IP addressing, TCP/OSI model, devices used in 
establishing a network and various protocols. Means these concepts are the prerequisite for being an ethical hacker.

In my upcoming blogs, the networking and linux's basic concepts will not be covered. This series will be dedicated only to 
the above six points and will be elaborated with all the tools and linux commands. If you are new to this and don't have
any prior knowledge about networking and linux, not to worry about. Each point will be discussed in detail, and surely you
will find interesting stuffs related to hacking.
