Footprinting is the first step a hacker does before hacking. In this step the hacker tries to gain information regading
the victim or target. Now it depends upon the intensions of the hacker if he does for the benifit of some organization
or if he has some malicious intensions. The hacker gets the knowledge regarding the level of risk that a particular
organization has. The hacker tries to find the open source information as well as the crucial information about
the organization in which he will try to get into.
There are two types of footprinting-<br>
<ul>

<li> Active Footprinting </li>
<li> Passive Footprinting </li>
</ul>

## Active Footprinting
In active footprinting the hacker directly interacts with the victim to gather information. This could be performed in<br>
various ways-<br>
<ul>
<li>Social engineering </li>
<li>Traceroute analysis </li>
<li>Extracting DNS information</li>
<li>Email tracking</li>
<li>Whois lookup </li>
</ul>

## Passive Footprinting
To gather information, the attacker tries to gather information without interacting to the victim directly.
This can be performed in various ways-
<ul>
<li>Stalking on social media</li>
<li>Advanced google search</li>
<li>Dumpster diving</li>
<li>Social engineering</li>
<li>From job portals</li>
</ul>

These are not the only ways to perform active/passive footprinting, rather there are many other ways too, to do so.<br>

# What information is usually gathered from footprinting?
Previously I have discussed about, what is the motive of footprinting and how it could be performed. But still it is not
known that what information has to be gathered about the target/victim. So basically following information can be gathered
about the victim-<br>
<ul>
<li>Operating System used by the target</li>
<li>Location of the target</li>
<li>Sub-domains of target website</li>
<li>IP address of the target</li>
<li>Whois records</li>
<li>User logins in target machine</li>
<li>Background of the target</li>
<li>Web technologies</li>
<li>Contact deatails</li>
</ul>

There are various tools by which footprinting can be done, and lots of information can be gathered.<br>
_This blog was all about the concept of footprinting. Now in the next part I will be discussing various_<br>
_tools by which information gathering can be done._<br>
