In my last blog I discussed the techniques to do footprinting with the help of linux OS. The first step for
the hacking is successfully completed by you all future hackers. Now this blog is regarding the second step
of hacking, i.e. **scanning**.

**Attention Future Hackers**
It is mandatory to have a Kali Linux (Parrot OS works too). None other linux distro should be used, because the
tools and commands I am going to discuss are installed beforehand in the Kali Linux. In other distros you will
have to additionally download and install the packages from internet and various dependencies too. You are
understanding the concepts of hacking, so it is mandatory for you to have Kali inux at least.

**CAUTION: For practicing hacking always try for these two websites:**

---

<ul>
<li><a href="http://certifiedhacker.com/">http://certifiedhacker.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://testphp.vulnweb.com/">http://testphp.vulnweb.com</a></li>
</ul>

**For practicing purpose there are other resources too, but as a beginner these two sites are recommended, other ways**
**will also be shared by me once you get the basic concepts, in my upcoming blogs. And sice you are practicing hacking,t**
**you should notry on some other websites other than the above two websites I mentioned, because you might end up breaking**
**something in other websites, also there are other security techniques implemented on those website which can keep**
**a track on you for doing malicious things and take some legal actions against you.**

# Types of Scanning

|Scanning Type|Description|
|-|-|
|Port Scanning|All the ports are scanned to know which is the open port and which is filtered. Also which services are currently running in target's device|
|Network Scanning|List all the devices up(live/active devices) in the network.|
|Vulnerability Scanning|To identify what all vulnerabilities are present in target device which can be exploited.|
|||

# Various flags in TCP communication
Whenever the connection is established between two devices(Server and Client), then certain flags are used to establish a connection
and 
data transfer between them. Certain flags are sent in the header of packets to establish connection and communication between the devices.
These flags are-

|Flag Name|Use|
|-|-|
|SYN| The first flag sent in order to setup a connection between client and server. Sent by the client to server to notify the server that client wants to connect the server.|
|ACK|The flag set in the response packet sent by the server, that it got its message. So it is just an acknowledgement sent in response of client's message.|
|PSH|When this flag is enabled when there is a data transfer between the client and the server|
|URG|This flag is enabled to acknowledge that the packet is urgent, and the data it contains should be processed first.|
|FIN|This flag marks the end of the communication between the client and server|
|RST|Flag is enabled when there is an error in the connection between the server and client, to abort the connection.|
|||

# Three Way Handshake
When a device connects to other device using TCP, then in background, to create this normal connection, three way handshake is done. It is
just the initial stage of the communication where the client confirms if server is up, server responses the client with acknowledgement and
confirms is client is up? Then the client responses again to server with acknowledgement that, yes, they are ready to communicate. Three way 
handshake is possible with the help of following flags:
``` code
1. SYN              [from client to server]
2. SYN + ACK        [from server to client]
3. ACK              [from client to server]
.
.                   [connection created and]
.                 [data is transferred between]
.                     [server and client]
.
4. FIN  [Request for termination of connection from client to server]
5. ACK              [From server to client]
6. FIN    [Ready to terminate the connection from server to client]     
7. ACK    [Ready to terminate the connection from client to server]     
==========================Session Terminated===========================
```

Above scenario is the actual scenario which shows the actual flag status during the connection establishment between client and server and termination of 
connection between server and client. Steps involved in step 1, 2 and 3 is called **three way hanshaking**. Purpose to discuss all this was to make you
aware about how a normal connection is established between client and server and how attackers don't follow this to hide their identity during scanning.


# Scanning Tools
## 1. Nmap
**Use:** Nmap is a vast tool for scanning a network and creating a "map" of the network.<br>
**Syntax:** nmap -options [IP address or Domain name]

Nmap is a vast tool with lots of options in order to scan a network, get the live host in a network, currently running services on target server/device, 
open/filtered ports of target server/device, can do OS fingeprinting and lot more. There are variety of scans we can perform with the help of nmap.

There are many options with the nmap tool, to see the whole documentation, see the manual of the nmap tool with the following command:
``` code
man nmap
```

<br><br>

### <u>Different Types of Scanning</u> 

**<u>1. TCP Connect Scan [-sT]</u>** <br>
This is the default TCP scan where the connection is established from attacker's device to the target's devices and port with the help of *connect()* 
system call. NMAP tries to connect different ports of the target's device and uses an API to get the information regarding the connection each time.
This scan is less efficient because there is a full **three way handshake** between a the attacker's device and target's device, rather than a half-open scan.
``` code
To run TCP Connect Scan type the followig command in terminal

nmap -sT certifiedhacker.com
```
![st](/assets/EthicalHacking/st.PNG)
<br><br>

**<u>2. TCP SYN Scan [-sS]</u>** <br>
This scan is also known as stealth scan and a better option over **TCP connect scan**, because it does not performs **three way handshake** with the 
target's device, which is why it is also called half-open scan. Following is the status of flag during SYN scan:

``` code
1. SYN                      [from client to server]
2. SYN + ACK                [from server to client]
3. RST         [from client to server and connection terminated]
```
The 3 steps shown above is not a **three way handshake**, because the 3rd step is the RST flag, instead of ACK flag, so connection is not established between the target's device and attacker's device.
If the **SYN + ACK** flag is sent by the target's device then it means that the port is open. If there is no response then port is marked as filtered
port.
``` code
To run Stealth Scan type the followig command in terminal

nmap -sS certifiedhacker.com
```
![ss](/assets/EthicalHacking/ss.PNG)
<br><br>

**<u>3. UDP Scan [-sU]</u>** <br>
In this scan the UDP packets are sent to the target device's ports. There is no three way handshake for UDP scan. UDP is used for broadcasting,
therefore it is difficult to find that the host is alive or not, or if the packet was lost, because in UDP the acknowledgement is not sent from the server to
client. Most of the times **ICMP_PORT_UNREACH** error is sent back to client. If this happens then that means that the port is open, else the port is not open.
``` code
To run UDP Scan type the followig command in terminal

nmap -sU certifiedhacker.com
```
![su](/assets/EthicalHacking/su.PNG)
<br><br>

**<u>4. Xmas Scan [-sX]</u>** <br>
In this type of scanning the three different flags are enabled in the packet, i.e. FIN, URG and PSH. If the port is open in the target's device then
no response is received. If the port is closed then in response a RST is sent back. The three flags are the random flag, trying to confuse the target's
device as the pattern of FIN, URG and PSH doesn't makes sense.
``` code
To run Xmas Scan type the followig command in terminal

nmap -sT certifiedhacker.com
```
![sx](/assets/EthicalHacking/sx.PNG)
<br><br>

**<u>5. ACK Scan [-sA]</u>** <br>
In this scan the ACK flag is enabled in the packet and then sent to the target's device. If the port is open or closed then the target device sent RST
packet in response. It generally determines that the port is unfiltered, but still we don't get to know that was that port open or close. Ports that don't 
respond  or sends back ICMP error are marked as filtered ports.
``` code
To run ACK Scan type the followig command in terminal

nmap -sA certifiedhacker.com
```
![sa](/assets/EthicalHacking/sa.PNG)
<br><br>

**<u>6. Idle (zombie) Scan [-sI]</u>** <br>
In this scan the TCP port scan is done but not from the actual IP address of the attacker's machine. Means this scan is very stealthy in nature. The information regarding the port is from the perspective of zombie.
``` code
To run Idle Scan type the followig command in terminal

nmap -sI certifiedhacker.com
```
![si](/assets/EthicalHacking/si.PNG)
<br><br>

**<u>7. TCP FIN Scan [-sF]</u>** <br>
This scan is just like Xmas scan, the difference is that it sends FIN flag enbled packets to the victim's device. If the port is open then no response
is got from the target device, else the port is closed. Similar is the case with NULL scan where no flag enabled packet is sent to the target's device.
``` code
To run FIN Scan type the followig command in terminal

nmap -sF certifiedhacker.com
```
![sf](/assets/EthicalHacking/sf.PNG)
<br><br>

**<u>8. OS fingerprinting [-O]</u>** <br>
With the help of Nmap the attacker can get the idea of the target device's OS and its version too. It tells the possibility of the OS in percentage based 
on the responses it gets from the target.
``` code
To do OS fingerprinting type the followig command in terminal

nmap -O certifiedhacker.com
```
![nmapo](/assets/EthicalHacking/nmapo.PNG)

### Following is the snapshot of the default scan, which shows the open ports of the respective website.
``` code
To run Default Scan type the followig command in terminal

nmap certifiedhacker.com
```
![nmap](/assets/EthicalHacking/nmap.PNG)
<br><br>

*It's not like you will always get output with some open, filtered or closed ports. These websites are much secured and are used only for examples.*
*If it is not secured enough then you will surely get to see the open/closed ports. You can create a LAN by a mobile hotspot and try this on you other*
*devices connected to the same hotspot, by writing IP address in pace of website's domain name.*

## 2. Hping3
**Use:** A command-line tool, used for network scanning and packet crafting.<br>
**Syntax:** hping3 -option [IP address of target]

Hping3 comes with various options and is used for network scanning, auditing, firewall testing, traceroute, OS fingerprinting etc. Even you can create
your custom packets with various fllags enabled and get the idea of response from the target. IP spoofing and scanning can be done with the help of it.
The information related to target OS can be gathered on the basis of the replies from victim's device and Time To Live (TTL) of packet.

**If TTL value is 64 then target OS is Linux OS and if TTL value is 128 then it is Windows OS.**
**If TCP window size is 5840 then target OS is Linux OS and if TCP window size is 16384 then it is Windows OS**

There are many options with this command. If you want to go through them then you can do as follows:
``` code
To get various options of Hping3 type the following
hping3 -h
```

### <u>Different Types of Scanning</u> 

**<u>1. ICMP ping</u>** <br>
Sends ICMP echo request to the IP address mentioned and then receives ICMP reply. Same as ping.
``` code
To do ICMP ping type the following in terminal
hping3 -1 [Target IP address]
```
![icmp](/assets/EthicalHacking/icmp.PNG)
<br><br>

**<u>2. ACK scan on port 80</u>** <br>
In this the ACK flag is enabled in probe packet and scanning is done. Done when host does not respond ping requests, to check if host is alive in network. Packet with RST flag enable
is sent back to the attacker if the host is live.
``` code
To do ACK scan on port 80 type the following in terminal
hping3 -A [Target IP address] -p 80
```
![ack](/assets/EthicalHacking/ack.PNG)
<br><br>

**<u>3. UDP scan on port 80</u>** <br>
In this, hping sends UDP packets to the specified port. If the port is closed then ICMP port unreachable message is received, and no response if port is open.
``` code
To do UDP scan on port 80 type the following in terminal
hping3 -2 [Target IP address] -p 80
```
![udp](/assets/EthicalHacking/udp.PNG)
<br><br>

**<u>4. Firewalls and time stamps</u>** <br>
We can find the timestamp update frequency and uptime of host with the help of this. Also sometimes the firewalls discard the TCP packets when packets don't
have timestamp set.
``` code
To know timestamp type the following in terminal
hping3 -S [Target IP address] -p 80 --tcp-timestamp
```
![timestamp](/assets/EthicalHacking/timestamp.PNG)
<br><br>

**<u>5. SYN scan</u>** <br>
Same thing as we discussed for Nmap.
``` code
To do SYN scan on a range of port type the following in terminal
hping3 -8 [Range of port(50-60)] [Target IP address] -V
```
![synh](/assets/EthicalHacking/synh.PNG)
<br><br>

**<u>6. Xmas scan</u>** <br>
Same as we discussed for Nmap, but in this we have to specify the flags explicitly. Remember that it used 3 different flags FIN, PSH and URG?
``` code
To do Xmas scan type the following in terminal
hping3 -F -P -U [Target IP address] -p 80
```
![xmash](/assets/EthicalHacking/xmash.PNG)
<br>

**You can also try DOS attack with HPING3 command on you virtual machine. I will discuss it in my upcoming blogs too.**

Mainly Nmap and Hping3 are used for scanning but other tools that you can try are-
1. NetScanTools Pro
2. PingSweep
3. SolarWinds Engineer's Toolset
4. Colasoft Ping Tester

<br>
<i>In this blog I discussed various ways of scanning the network with the help of two amazing and widly used tools, Nmap and Hping3. You can try these techniques on your home network, by using your mobile hotspot and connecting PCs and using various VMs in your device. Use one of the devices as an attacker device and try gaining information of your network.</i><br>
