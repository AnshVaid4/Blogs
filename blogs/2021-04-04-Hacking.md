In my last blog I discussed the techniques regarding how to perform vulnerability scanning. We used Windows as well as
Linux tool to perform vulnerability assessment. So
now we were able to perform footprinting, scanning, enumeration and vulnerability assessment for the target, we have to start with the system
hacking. So, now we are ready to start with system hacking.

**Attention Future Hackers**
It is mandatory to have a Kali Linux (Parrot OS works too). None other linux distro should be used, because the
tools and commands I am going to discuss are installed beforehand in the Kali Linux. In other distros you will
have to additionally download and install the packages from internet and various dependencies too. You are
understanding the concepts of hacking, so it is mandatory for you to have Kali inux at least.

**CAUTION: For practicing hacking always try for these two websites:**

---

<ul>
<li><a href="http://certifiedhacker.com/">http://certifiedhacker.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://testphp.vulnweb.com/">http://testphp.vulnweb.com</a></li>
</ul>

**For practicing purpose there are other resources too, but as a beginner these two sites are recommended, other ways**
**will also be shared by me once you get the basic concepts, in my upcoming blogs. And sice you are practicing hacking,t**
**you should notry on some other websites other than the above two websites I mentioned, because you might end up breaking**
**something in other websites, also there are other security techniques implemented on those website which can keep**
**a track on you for doing malicious things and take some legal actions against you.**

**Also this blog on hacking is just for informative purpose. Kindly use the knowledge given below wisely and for ethical purpose only. You are here to learn cyber security, and not to harm people by using your knowledge in unethical way.**

# <u>Metasploit Framework</u>
The metasploit framework also known as MSF is a very vast tool provided in kali linux, and later was introduced to parrot OS and all. The very first version had only few modules aroud 4 I guess, but later as a project
It gradually expanded and now it is a full fledge tool for the penetration testers. You have got a very powerfull console which can do:
1. Enumeration
2. Vulnerability assessment
3. Fuzzing
4. Cracking passwords
5. Dumping hashes
6. Scanning
and what not related to penetration testing. So the **Metasploit Framework** is a very vast topic which I will be discussing in some other blog. Till then you can have a look at our video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSslLaEu9ms">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSslLaEu9ms</a>.
<br>

**One important thing related to MSF is whenever you use the exploit module then you have to use the payload for that module too.**

<br>
Currently in this blog I will show you how you can get a reverse connection from a target Windows OS and do what not with that system as an attacker. The Windows OS will become the victim machine, and I will show how to hack it.
<br>

**Basically this attack is just to show you all emerging hackers that what happens if you download any software from an illegitimate website or get any cracked version of sme paid software from some website.**

## <u>Lab Setup</u>
1. Windows OS<br>
   -> Windows XP<br>
   -> Windows 7<br>
   -> Windows 8  (Turn off the defender)<br>
   -> Windows 10 (Turn off the defender)<br>

2. Kali Linux

Though we can bypass the defender, but for that I will need to change some code and add some random things to it. But for now to understand I am attempting on a basic level.
<br>

# <u>Hacking Windows OS</u>
1. I created an executable file named as <b>vuln.exe</b> for the Windows OS, which will act as a cracked software of a paid software that the victim was trying to get from many days. And now this executable file is installed on the victim machine.<br>
The snapshot below shows the victim machine of Windows 7 OS, installed with **vuln.exe** file.

2. Open the msf in kali with the command **msfconsole -q** OR **msfconsole**. Difference is, in first one you will not get the banner and second one you will get the banner. It's up to you, which one you want. You will get the screen as shown below:

3. Now I will use the **exploit/multi/handler** module which is used for handling various payloads. And to see its options use **show options**. Set LPORT and LHOST, which is listening port and listening host IP address. I will also set the payload **windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp** which helps me in getting the reverse shell of windows.

4. Following snapshot shows the final settings of the **exploit/multi/handler** module.

5. Now we are ready to start the exploit, by running **exploit** command.
6. Now we will get the connection from widows machine as soon as that exe file runs in the victim's machine.
7. Following snapshot shows the reverse connection established at the msf, and we got the meterpreter shell.

8. You can get the live view of the desktop, upload or download files to it, turn on his device's camera, get NTLM hashes of SAM file etc etc.. The SAM file concept is discussed in <a href="https://blog.vulnfreak.org/posts/PasswordCrack/">Cracking Password</a> blog. Following is the snapshot for dumping hashes of the password of victim's machine.

9.  After this you can also create a persistence, so that next time when the victim comes online again, then also the connection is created automatically.
<br>

**All these steps were used to show you the demo about what all could happen if you download any software from illegitimate website. You can get hacked in the same way too. So avoid such cracked versions, or if you download then it should be trustable one.**<br>
*Similarly I will be discussing the same for hacking the Linux OS in upcoming blogs. Also I will be discussing how to crack the hashes, that we got in the above meterpreter shell or by some other methods too.*
