In my last blog I discussed the techniques regarding how the Windows OS got hacked with the help of **Metasploit Framework**, and that was just a small part I used to show you all about using MSF but it is way bigger tool, having lots of modules. And most probably I would discuss about other modules too. They are easy to use, just like we used our /multi/handler module. You just have to change their options to make the work fine. Also the right module should be selected at right time, otherwise the module will not work. For Linux hacking assume that we have performed footprinting, scanning, enumeration and vulnerability assessment for the target, we have to start with the system
hacking. So, now we are ready to start with system hacking.

**Attention Future Hackers**
It is mandatory to have a Kali Linux (Parrot OS works too). None other linux distro should be used, because the
tools and commands I am going to discuss are installed beforehand in the Kali Linux. In other distros you will
have to additionally download and install the packages from internet and various dependencies too. You are
understanding the concepts of hacking, so it is mandatory for you to have Kali inux at least.

**CAUTION: For practicing hacking always try for these two websites:**

---

<ul>
<li><a href="http://certifiedhacker.com/">http://certifiedhacker.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://testphp.vulnweb.com/">http://testphp.vulnweb.com</a></li>
</ul>

**For practicing purpose there are other resources too, but as a beginner these two sites are recommended, other ways**
**will also be shared by me once you get the basic concepts, in my upcoming blogs. And sice you are practicing hacking,t**
**you should notry on some other websites other than the above two websites I mentioned, because you might end up breaking**
**something in other websites, also there are other security techniques implemented on those website which can keep**
**a track on you for doing malicious things and take some legal actions against you.**

**Also this blog on hacking is just for informative purpose. Kindly use the knowledge given below wisely and for ethical purpose only. You are here to learn cyber security, and not to harm people by using your knowledge in unethical way.**

This is a short blog because Linux is basically a way different OS than windows, which does not supports exe files. All you need to scan is for misconfiguration or loophole in order to hack the Linux OS.

# <u>Scenario</u>
So we are always told that the linux operating system is the safest operating system. You never get hacked with Linux OS. But the fact is if you have vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, or week passwords even then also even if you are using Linux or any other OS, you will be hacked easily. So in this blog I am going to show how Linux can also be hacked if some misconfigurations are there.<br>

## <u>Lab Setup</u>
1. Two Linux machines<br>
   -> One of them should be kali
<br>

# <u>Hacking Linux</u>
So now I will show that how **secured OS** also gets hacked due to some misconfigurations and the negligence of the administrator of the Linux OS.<br>

1. During the scan I got that the target linux machine is having SSH service open.
2. Now if somehow I get /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow file from that target, it will be great.
3. The target device is logged in as privileged user. If it is not so then you can compromise the user itself and do privilege escalation.
4. So since here the target is logged in as privileged user then it is not a big deal.
5. Get the password of root by using hydra. The following snapshot shows the method to get the root password with the help of ssh service.

6. Now we can get the copy of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow file with the help of file sharing command such as scp **scp [Victim IP]:[filename] [destination to save the copied file]** or simply with **ssh [username]@[IP]** and entering password then getting the data of the file.

7. Use command **unshadow passwd shadow > newshadow** to map the usernames and there password hashes.
8. Then crack the hashes with **john the ripper** or if you have some other persnalized dictionary.

<br>
These are the basic ways where a person who don't have much knowledge about the configurations, and running services on default settings can get attacked. Turn off the services which are not in use always. This was about the single SSH service, there are other ways too.<br>

I will also discuss the techniques to get the password hashes and various ways to crack them in my upcoming blogs also. Till then use **john the ripper** tool. *Also I will show how the android devices can also be hacked in the similar way I showed you about Windows OS.*
