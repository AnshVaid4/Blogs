In my last blog I discussed the techniques regarding how the Linux OS got hacked with the help of exploiting **SSH service** as it was running in privileged mode, and this was done because the services were running even when they were not in use and someone might try to use it in unethical way.Similarly the other services can be exploited in unethical way, it just depends upon the attacker. For Android hacking assume that we have performed footprinting, scanning, enumeration and vulnerability assessment for the target, we have to start with the system
hacking. So, now we are ready to start with system hacking.

**Attention Future Hackers**
It is mandatory to have a Kali Linux (Parrot OS works too). None other linux distro should be used, because the
tools and commands I am going to discuss are installed beforehand in the Kali Linux. In other distros you will
have to additionally download and install the packages from internet and various dependencies too. You are
understanding the concepts of hacking, so it is mandatory for you to have Kali inux at least.

**CAUTION: For practicing hacking always try for these two websites:**

---

<ul>
<li><a href="http://certifiedhacker.com/">http://certifiedhacker.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://testphp.vulnweb.com/">http://testphp.vulnweb.com</a></li>
</ul>

**For practicing purpose there are other resources too, but as a beginner these two sites are recommended, other ways**
**will also be shared by me once you get the basic concepts, in my upcoming blogs. And sice you are practicing hacking,t**
**you should notry on some other websites other than the above two websites I mentioned, because you might end up breaking**
**something in other websites, also there are other security techniques implemented on those website which can keep**
**a track on you for doing malicious things and take some legal actions against you.**

**Also this blog on hacking is just for informative purpose. Kindly use the knowledge given below wisely and for ethical purpose only. You are here to learn cyber security, and not to harm people by using your knowledge in unethical way.**

# <u>How Android Gets Hacked</u>
Android is a linux based mobile operating system. For android, again we have suitable modules present in the **Metasploit Framework**. But for educational purpose, that how your phone can also be hacked if you download some cracked version of any apk from some website which is not a trusted one may end up with your android phone hacked. In the current world where many games are being build up for android platform, such as **pubg**, players try to get various mods and hacks in order to improve there gameplay, or to boost their XPs. They simply get the paid utilities in original apk, totally free of cost, but there is nothing in this universe that you get free of cost. If you got those utilities then there is something which *"they" are getting in return* OR *"they" will get in future*. As I discussed in the blog of Windows OS hacking, it is a risky task to download some third-party apps. These apps may be sharing your phone's data in the backend and you might not even know.

## <u>Lab Setup</u>
1. Android phone
2. Kali Linux
<br>

# <u>Scenario and Steps</u>
In this, suppose an android user is searching for an apk can increase the battery life of the phone, and came accross an apk name **MainActivity.apk**. Which he downloaded to check if this apk helps his/hers device. Following ar the steps how I will gain the access to this victim's android phone:
![hack](/assets/EthicalHacking/android1.png)
<br>

1. I will again use the **exploit/multi/handler** module, because the application that is being accessed by the victim will try to connect to my device in backend. Following snapshot shows my MSF shell:

2. I have set the options of this module and started listening for some connections at port 1212. Following snapshot shows setting the values of options of the module.

3. Now run the exploit to listen for connections.
4. As soon as the victim opens the **MainActivity.apk**, the reverse connection to my MSF is created. Run **sysinfo** command to get the system details of the device which has connected to MSF.

5. I can dump the contacts and messages of the android phone, turn on his camera, get the live streaming of his screen, unlock his phone remotely, start any apk at its phone etc etc. One of these things I have shone below.<br>
This snapshot below shows the messages of victim device.

This snapshot below shows the contact information of victim device.

6. The snapshot below showing the contact list I got after dumping to my attacker's machine.

7. The snapshot below showing the messages I got after dumping to my attacker's machine.

8. The snapshot below shows the list of applications installed in victim's device. The list was longer, not all applications are present in this snapshot.

This was a basic demo attack that I shown in this blog, **just to show you how the hackers can get your android phone, why you should not install the applications from the third-party websites**. You have to make yourself aware about how your device can be exploited because of your mistake. There are other ways also how your device can be exploited, **And one warning: NEVER ROOT YOUR ANDROID DEVICE, because this will log you into admin mode of android, and you saw in Linux hacking blog, what was the result of running the service in prileged mode.**<br>

*I hope this blog was informative to those of cyber security peeps out there and to other people as well, might have given you the idea what not to do in your Android devices.* <br>
*In my next blog I will be discussing various techniques to crack the passwords, as I mentioned earlier in my Linux hacking blog.*
