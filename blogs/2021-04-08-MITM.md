In my last blog of the series **Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking**, I gave you a glimpse of how your android phone can get hacked because of your negligence. Any third party app or any other apk from the non trustable website can lead to our device compromisation, which I showed with the help of a demo where the android based device got hacked with the help of a small apk. Yes I remember that I had to discuss the various techniques to perform password cracking, but that blog I will be sharing after this. And believe me this blog will also going to be very intersting.
<br>

**Attention Future Hackers**
It is mandatory to have a Kali Linux (Parrot OS works too). None other linux distro should be used, because the
tools and commands I am going to discuss are installed beforehand in the Kali Linux. In other distros you will
have to additionally download and install the packages from internet and various dependencies too. You are
understanding the concepts of hacking, so it is mandatory for you to have Kali inux at least.

**CAUTION: For practicing hacking always try for these two websites:**

---

<ul>
<li><a href="http://certifiedhacker.com/">http://certifiedhacker.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://testphp.vulnweb.com/">http://testphp.vulnweb.com</a></li>
</ul>

**For practicing purpose there are other resources too, but as a beginner these two sites are recommended, other ways**
**will also be shared by me once you get the basic concepts, in my upcoming blogs. And sice you are practicing hacking,t**
**you should notry on some other websites other than the above two websites I mentioned, because you might end up breaking**
**something in other websites, also there are other security techniques implemented on those website which can keep**
**a track on you for doing malicious things and take some legal actions against you.**

**Also this blog on hacking is just for informative purpose. Kindly use the knowledge given below wisely and for ethical purpose only. You are here to learn cyber security, and not to harm people by using your knowledge in unethical way.**

# <u>What Is MITM?</u>
Man In The Middle attack or MITM is a very dangerous attack where the existing connection from one client to the server is intercepted by the attacker and attacker simply listens and records the communication that is being going on between them. Also the intersting thing about this is that the attacker can also manipulate the data that is being sent from client to server. So if the client is accessing some HTTP based website then the credentials will be viible to the attacker, but if the client is accessing some HTTPS based website, then he will gradually have to decrypt the credentials. But still it can be manipulated. So in this way this attack is different from sniffing attack.

## <u>More On MITM</u>
The attacker in this attack tries different methods to split the existing connection between the client and server. Maybe DOS ttack can also work. DOS is also an attack, I will discuss it in later blog. Similar to Man In The Middle attack is Man In The Browser attack, where the browser gets compromised. 

``` code
IN NORMAL CONNECTION

        ||                                                                                    ||

# <u>MITM Demo</u>
Being the cyber security enthusiasts, until you see the things live, it is not easy to believe on such theorotical things. And yes it is good to be curious. Let's see how this is done:

## <u>Attack</u>

<ol>
<li style="font-size:110%;">I have one attacking machine with Kali linux and victim machine Windows 7</li>
<li style="font-size:110%;">I have already setup some setting in attacker's machine related to the proxy.</li>
<li style="font-size:110%;">Now I opened <b>burpsuite</b> and did the required changes for the attack, shown in the snapshot below.</li>
<br>
<img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/mitm1.PNG"/>
<img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/mitm2.PNG"/>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<li style="font-size:110%;">The snapshot below shows the Victim's machine where the browser is opened.</li>
<br>
<img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/mitm3.PNG" />
<br>
<br>
<br>
<li style="font-size:110%;">I entered <a href="http://testphp.vulnweb.com">http://testphp.vulnweb.com</a> and press the enter button on keyboard.</li>
<br>
<img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/mitm4.PNG" />
<br>
<br>
<br>
<li style="font-size:110%;">The moment I press the enter the page starts loading and the request is sent to the attacker's machine. Where I press on forward button to forward this request to browser.</li>
<br>
<img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/mitm5.PNG" />
<br>
<br>
<br>
<li style="font-size:110%;">The same happens when I open its <a href="http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php"><b>Signup</b></a> and forwarded that request to the server to open this page shown below. And I enetered the <b>Username</b> and <b>Password</b> there and click on login button.</li>
<br>
<img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/mitm6.PNG"/>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<li style="font-size:110%;">The request is again sent to my attacker's machine where <b>uname</b> and <b>pass</b> is showing the <b>username</b> and <b>password</b> I entered in victim's machine.</li>
<br>
<img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/mitm7.PNG"/>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<li style="font-size:110%;">I can easily change the fields of <b>uname</b> and <b>pass</b>. As shown below.</li>
<br>
<img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/mitm8.PNG"/>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<li style="font-size:110%;">But I at last change the <b>uname</b> and <b>pass</b> fields to <b>test</b> and <b>test</b>. Which are the default username and password of the signup page.</li>
<br>
<img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/mitm9.PNG"/>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<li style="font-size:110%;">Now see the username that is logged in to the page. The username with <b>test</b> username i.e. <b>John Smith</b> is logged in.</li>
<br>
<img src="/assets/EthicalHacking/mitm10.PNG"/>
<br>
<br>
</ol>
<br>

In the same way other malicious things are performed, such as stealing session IDs and all, are also performed by the hackers with unethical mindset. Now the latest versions can also detect the attacks, if they are happening with you, but still there are many ways to bypass. This way the MITM is performed and your data can be compromised.
