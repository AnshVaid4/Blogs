In my last blog, I discussed about the concept of block headers, need of block headers, concept of merkle tree, need of merkle root in block header and nonce. In this blog I am going to disuss other headers which were left in last blog and also I will discuss how the block hash can be determined fro the block headers.

# 1. <u>Block Headers</u>
To get the block hash the miners have to combine the block headers to get the particular hash starting with some zeroes. Actualy miners don't have to combine, all this is the backend process of mining software, but you should be knowing this. Following are the block headers which are combined to get a block hash:<br>
<ol>
<li><b>Block Version</b></li>
<li><b>Previous Block Hash</b></li>
<li><b>Merkle Root</b></li>
<li><b>Timestamp</b></li>
<li><b>Bits</b></li>
<li><b>Nonce</b></li>
</ol>
<br>

From the above list of headers, I have discussed about Merkle Root and Nonce in last blog. Let's dig into other headers of bitcoin blockchain.<br>

# 2. <u>Block Version</u>
It is nothing but simply the version of the blockchain, started with the version **0x1** when the genesis bock was created. Genesis block is the first block of any blockchain. Currently the version of bitcoin blockchain is **0x20000004**. The snap below shows the version of bitcoin block 2021.<br>

# 3. <u>Previous Block Hash</u>
Previous blockhash is the hash of the block which is just before the block for whom the block hash is being calculated. This is used just to create a link between the blocks so that if someone does any changes in some previous block then all the following blocks are afftected, and we come to know easily whose content has been changed. The snap below shows the hash of block 2020, which is the previous block hash of block 2021 in bitcoin.<br>

# 4. <u>Timestamp</u>
Timestamp is just to keep a track that double spending does not occur (as discussed in previous blogs), the time which is actually marked for the block is the epoch time, it is the standard time which is also the time used in Linux Operating System. But for convenience, it is shown in the format of **yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm**  in the block. The snap shown below shows the timestamp of block 2021 in bitcoin.<br>

<br>

# 5. <u>Bits</u>
It is a 4 byte threshold value which specifies the difficulty level, the leading zeroes in target hash depends on this. How 4 byte? you need to convert the decimal value of bits to hexadecimal form. Then it is in the 4 byte format. The below snap shows the decimal value of bits.<br>

# 6. <u>Confirming Block Hash</u>
The bitcoin blockchain is designe in such a way, that finding the hash is difficult, its a heavy load on CPU and GPU while finding a hash which is present in the given range (I discussed the range concept in previous blogs), and it all depends on nonce. You get a particular nonce value and you got your target hash beginning with desired number of zeroes. **But** it is easy to confirm the block, once it is created. Miners confirm the block by using the same headers and which has nonce in it too, in the software which checks whether the hash found was correct or not. I am going to show the working of such software with the help of python code I created. <!--Link for code is <a href="https://github.com/AnshVaid4/Python/blob/master/blockHashConfirmation.py"><b>https://github.com/AnshVaid4/Python/blob/master/blockHashConfirmation.py</b></a>.--> The program is for **block 1** of bitcoin blockchain, you can run and verify that the same hash is displayed by the program as that of the hash displayed in <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/1">block 1</a>. Copy and paste to your python IDLE and change the headers accordingly for the respective block whose block hash you want to validate. It will show the block hash if your headers are correct. Following is the explanation about how the block hash is actually created.<br>

The alsgorithm is very basic, you need the little endian format of all the headers. In little endian, the binary of the string is converted from right to left format. Let's see with an example:<br>

Following are the four bytes in hexadecimal format:<br>
**0x17 14 96 24** <br><br>

When they are converted to little endian, then it becomes:<br>
**0x24 96 14 17** <br><br>

Just the reverse, i.e. the 32 bit binary representation will convert from **00010111 00010100 10010110 00100100** to **00100100 10010110 00010100 00010111**.<br>

Just have a look on binary digits, the first octet in **00010111 00010100 10010110 00100100** i.e. **00010111** has gone to the end as last octet in **00100100 10010110 00010100 00010111**. Similarly other transitions take place, and to do this I have function **littleEndian(val)** and **hex2Little(val)** in my program whose purpose is to convert to little endian in the same way.<br>

The headers are converted to little endian format and then hashed together twice with **SHA256** algorithm. And what you get at the end is the hash of the block.<br>
**IMPORTANT:** Remember this is not called mining, you are not calculating the nonce of the block to get the hash. Infact, you know all the headers and you are just performing mathematical operations on those headers to validate that the headers are correct.<br>

**IMPORTANT:** Remember that order of combining the little endian values of header which will later be hashed with SHA256 algorithm will always be in same order, i.e. **version + previous block hash + merkle root hash + time + bits + nonce**, if your order changes, then you will get the wrong hash even if your headers are correct. Version is always given in decimal value, and not in hexadecimal value.<br>
Now if you know the headers of a block, you can easily find its respective hash of the block. The code for the same are present in my GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/AnshVaid4/Python/tree/master/BTC%20blockchain">https://github.com/AnshVaid4/Python/tree/master/BTC%20blockchain</a><br>

<br>

In this blog I have discussed various concepts related to the hash of the block, I have also discussed about the program with which you can easily find the hash of the block and also discussed about the other headers of a block which I left in last blog. The conceptual implementation could be found in the CTF challenge **Does A Second Matter**. If you missed the CTF then you can read the writeup at <a href="https://medium.com/vulnfreak/does-a-second-matter-10f5984e5061">https://medium.com/vulnfreak/does-a-second-matter-10f5984e5061</a>. In the next blog I will discuss how the cryptography works for the bitcoin, to create a wallet address.
