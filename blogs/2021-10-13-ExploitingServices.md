Here is another blog for my series of **Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking**. Since the October month is known for **National Cyber Security Awareness Month**, so this blog will describe how the default passwords or unnecessarily running services on a device make it very vulnerable, and by exploiting them attacker easily hacks into your network or device. There is a very popular website which I have discussed earlier also in the blogs of **Information Gathering**, <a href="https://shodan.io"><i>shodan.io</i></a> which lists all the IOT devices around the world with there open ports i.e. the services they are running with a proper description, and all these information is open to the whole world through this website. Just the attacker has to exploit the service, or even if he don't know how to exploit, still he can google the exploit. Let's search where IOTs and also I will show the common service which runs on various android phones and how attacker can exploit it and hack your android.<br><br>

**Also this blog on hacking is just for informative purpose. Kindly use the knowledge given below wisely and for ethical purpose only. You are here to learn cyber security, and not to harm people by using your knowledge in unethical way.**

# 1.<u>Let's Dig Into Shodan.io</u>
![hack](/assets/EthicalHacking/shodan2.PNG)

<br>

The above snap is the homepage of <a href="https://shodan.io"><i>shodan.io</i></a> website. Create an account for premium features but still if you don't have an account, you will be able to search and get lots of info. As we have *Google Dorks*, also known as Google Hacking commands in GHDB, which help in filtering the search results, in the same way we have filter command in shodan.io website, to filter the results accordingly. Some mostly used filters are:

<ul>
<li><b>os:</b> Helps to filter specific operating system in the results</li>
<li><b>port:</b> Helps to filter the specific port number in the search results</li>
<li><b>city:</b> Helps to filter the results for specific city in the whole world</li>
<li><b>country:</b> A 2 letter country code which helps to filter the specific results for specific country </li>
<li><b>geo:</b> Helps to filter the specific results according to the coordinates given</li>
</ul>

<br>

# 2.<u>Searching IOTs</u>
Let's search for the open webcams in the world, just type **Webcam** or even **Webcamxp** in the search bar to see various open webcams. Now some results will be marked with a **HONEYPOT** tag by shodan, so beware from them, cz honeypots are intentionally installed to catch the hackers. Below are some snapshots related to this search:<br>

<br>

So it shows me the first IP as a honeypoot, and you can check if it's not a false positve from <a href="https://honeyscore.shodan.io/">https://honeyscore.shodan.io/</a>. But the second result is a genuie webcam, which is showing me the live view of it.

<br>

Now let's search the devices which might have the default passwords in their login portal. The snapshot below shows the same:<br>

![hack](/assets/EthicalHacking/defaultpassword1.PNG)
![hack](/assets/EthicalHacking/defaultpassword2.PNG)

<br>

When I scroll the results then I get some IPs where the default username "cisco" and default password "cisco" is detected by shodan. There are high chances of that IP having a cisco router, with these default credentials.<br>

This is why the default passwords should be changed for the IOT devices or any other account, they can easily be attacked. Now let's try exploiting a service which runs in android and try to access it. It's only for information purpose and not to harm any device, just to show that if any service is not needed then switch it off rather keeping it on.

<br>

# 3.<u>Android Debug Bridge</u>
Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is the service used to transfer data from android to other device. But many times it is left on when not in use. I will try to exploit it on a device and try to just connect. Don't try it without the concent of the person whose device it is, but in learning cyber securtiy you must know the exploits and vulnerabilities. Try to be on ethical side. So let's scan the same on shodan.io. The snap below shows the same:<br>

![hack](/assets/EthicalHacking/adb.PNG)

<br>

You can connect to these devices using a tool called <a href="https://github.com/EntySec/Ghost"><b>Ghost</b></a>, or install using the command

```
apt-get install ghost
```

**REMINDER: Don't harm the device or compromize it for malicious purpose. It's only for educational purpose, kindly don't misuse your knowledge.**

**In this blog I have discussed various techniwues to scan the IOT devices around the world with the help of Shodan.io website, filtering out the results and also the risk of having default passwords and services running unnecessarily on device.**
