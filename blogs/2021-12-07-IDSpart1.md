In this blog I am going to discuss the concept of Intrusion Detection System (IDS). I will be practically showing how the IDS works, how it can be configured. Before that let's understand what is IDS.
IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is software or it can be a hardware used for securing an endpoint and perimeter. They are of two types:
HIDS (Host Intrusion Detection System)
NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System)

The names suggests their functionalities respectively, that a HIDS would be used for monitoring the requests made to any particular host, so that the malicious or unwanted requests which can compromise the host by exposing its sensitive data or affecting it in some or the other way could be blocked and even gets logged for the security purposes. Later during the log audit for that respective host can expose the IP address and the request (packet) sent by it to that host. Then it depends whether the company to which that host belongs, whether they want to block (blacklist) that IP or take any other steps against it. 
Similarly, the NIDS is for monitoring the packets that are being transferred in a network, so that any malicious packet was not sent within a network which could compromise the whole network (like pivoting) or any ARP poisoning or ICMP ping probes flooding attack etc. Everything gets logged, and if anything which is suspicious is found then the alert is sent to Chief Security Officer (CSO) of the company/organization.
The two categories that I have discussed above, can be bifurcated into two more categories:
Rule based IDS
Heuristics based IDS

In Rule based IDS, the specific rules are mentioned, where the type of packet is described which has to be particularly monitored, such as the packet of specific protocol (TCP/UDP/ICMP) coming from specific source IP and port number to the specific destination IP and port number of the device has to be blocked or logged or alert to CSO. These are known as rules, which need to be manually defined by the organization/company according to there security needs for there perimeter and nodes.
In Heuristics based IDS, there is no concept of defining the rules explicitly by the company/organization, rather it depends on the behavior of the packet. This type of IDS is intelligent enough to take decisions on its own whether to drop the specific packet or not. So you can infer that it would be having the predefined signatures like Windows Defender and it could learn on its own if some extra rules are defined to it explicitly.

IMPORTANT:
I will be using an open source tool known as Snort IDS. You can download it from https://www.snort.org/, but you will need to integrate the various files in the main folder of Snort.
Therefore I have uploaded a zip file in my GitHub repo https://github.com/AnshVaid4/Python/tree/master/Snort (RECOMMENDED) where I have done various changes beforehand.
Recommended Windows 7 OS for this tool. You can use VM
Download and extract the zip file on your desktop. Then install Snort_2_9_5_6_Installer.exe in C drive of Windows OS and after that still some changes have to be done because the configuration file is from Linux OS, therefore the syntax used in it is different. Since we are using it in Windows OS, therefore we have to make the changes in those syntax. I will be discussing them below. The file I am using can run in Windows 7 and not in windows 10 because it's just for demonstration purpose only. So if you have Windows 7 VM then you can use it and follow the steps below to configure it.
Download the zip file and download Snort_2_9_5_6_Installer, then download WinPcap_4_1_3, so that NIC could be accessed by IDS. WinPcap in Windows is same as AirPcap in Linux OS.
Now go to snortrules folder, and copy preproc_rules, rules, so_rules and paste in C:\Snort folder. Replace the folders.
Replace the folder in C:\Snort

Now go to etc folder and copy snort.conf file and paste in C:\Snort\etc folder and replace it.

![hack](/assets/CyberForensics/ids3.png)
![hack](/assets/CyberForensics/ids4.png)

Replace the file in C:\Snort\etc



After doing these changes, run command prompt and got to C:\Snort\bin and then run snort.exe file, to ensure it is working fine. 
Now check the interfaces where you can run snort by executing snort.exe -W command.

The above snap is from Windows10 machine, to show the output, but in actual I will be using Windows 7 machine. Some files need to be updated to make it work in Windows 10. You would be able to see a NIC whose MAC address is not 00:00:00:00:00:00, in my case it is Index 2, which is having MAC address not equal to 00:00:00:00:00:00. Therefore every time when I will run Snort IDS, I will be running it for interface 2, by using option snort.exe -i 2, where, -i option is for setting the interface, which is 2 in my case.

Required Changes In Configuration Files
1. Open snort.conf in etc folder

2. Go to line 45 and change ipvar HOME_NET any with var HOME_NET <Your host's local IP address for whom you will be running this IDS> [Local IP of machine can be found using ipconfig command in cmd]. In my case it's var HOME_NET 192.168.248.134

3. Go to line104 and change var RULE_PATH ../rules with var RULE_PATH c:\snort\rules. Similarly change the path of ../so_rules and ../preproc_rules with c:\snort\so_rules and c:\snort\preproc_rules respectively on line 105 and 106, because ../ is used in Linux OS, therefore I have changed the paths according to Windows OS. Sometimes ../ works in Windows OS too, but we can't take chance of error.
4. Go to line 243 and change dynamicpreprocessor directory /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicpreprocessor/ with dynamicpreprocessor directory c:\snort\lib\snort_dynamicpreprocessor. Similarly do for line 246, change dynamicengine /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicengine/libsf_engine.so with dynamicengine c:\snort\lib\snort_dynamicengine\sf_engine.dll, because it's Windows OS, the paths will be different and .so file is actually .dll file in Windows OS.
5. Go to line 249 and comment the whole line by introducing a # symbol in the beginning of the line. Therefore the line is converted to #dynamicdetection directory /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrules.
6. Similarly comment all the lines from 261–265 using # symbol in the beginning.

Line 261–265 in snort.conf7. Similarly comment the lines from 502–507 using # symbol in the beginning.
Line 502–507 in snort.conf8. Go to line 529 and convert include classification.config with include c:\snort\etc\classification.config and similarly convert line 530 include reference.config with include c:\snort\etc\reference.config
9. Add output alert_fast: alert.ids at line 531
10. Now replace ipvar with var in the file. I have done it before hand, therefore getting 0 occurrences. You will get 11 occurrences replaced message in the bottom.

Replace ipvar with var11. 
11. Now save your configuration file using ctrl+s.

In this blog I have discussed about the Intrusion Detection System (IDS), what is the use of it, and why it is useful. I have shared the links and resources of the tool in the beginning of blog so that you can also try it doing practically, and understand the concept of IDS clearly. In the next part of blog I will show how you can create the rules for the IDS. The next part of the blog is fully practical based.
