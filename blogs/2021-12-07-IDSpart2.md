In my previous blog I discussed about the concept of Intrusion Detection System (IDS), various types of IDS and how it works. I also discussed about the open source tool Snort IDS, and configured various files so that we can implement the concepts of IDS practically and understand them. If you missed the previous blog then kindly check it, so that you can configure the same files properly. 
IMPORTANT:
I will be using an open source tool known as Snort IDS. You can download it from https://www.snort.org/, but you will need to integrate the various files in the main folder of Snort.
Therefore I have uploaded a zip file in my GitHub repo https://github.com/AnshVaid4/Python/tree/master/Snort (RECOMMENDED) where I have done various changes beforehand.
Recommended Windows 7 OS for this tool. You can use VM

Creating The Rules For Various Protocols
Rules are given to the IDS so that if it counters any packet which comply to the rule, appropriate actions could be taken against that packet. With the help of rules we generally blacklist certain kinds of packets incoming to the host. We are done with the configuration file of snort. Now for creating rules, go to C:\Snort\rules folder. There are various files for protocol, where you can define the rules for each of them. Let's say you want to create a rule for ICMP packet. ICMP packet is received to the host when any other device/computer pings the host. Like we do ping google.com in cmd. In this case ICMP packet is sent to the server of Google.
For this open icmp.rules file in notepad.

Currently no rule is defined in the file. So let's define a rule for this.
Rules are defined in a syntax. The syntax is as follows:
[action] [protocol] [source IP address] [port number] -> [destination IP address] [port number] (msg:["Any Message In Double Quotes"]; sid:[any number])
Everything in above syntax is self explanatory. One thing to understand is action. Mainly we set action with one of the four values given below, though there are more actions also present. The main actions are:
alert : Sends alert message for the packet which comply to rules we have defined in the respective rule file.
log : Simply log the packet in the file which comply to rules we have defined in the respective rule file.
pass : This action ignores the packet which comply to rules we have defined in the respective rule file.
reject : Blocks the packets and logs it in file which comply to rules we have defined in the respective rule file.

I have written a rule for ICMP packet which is coming from any external IP with any port number to my host IP with any port number.
alert icmp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"Bad Ping probes"; sid:1212;)
Notice here that I have used $EXTERNAL_NET and $HOME_NET in above rule. They are simply the variables that are defined in snort.conf file. You can use other variables in the same way by adding $ in the beginning. Or simply if there are some set of External IPs from whom you want to create the rule then you can write the comma (,) separated IPs like I have shown below:
alert icmp xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"Bad Ping probes"; sid:1212;)
where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy are two IPs for which we want to log if we get any ICMP packets from them. $HOME_NET contains the IP address of host, which we defined earlier in snort.conf file. One more keyword which I have used in above rule is any. "any" is used when we want to specify any IP address, or any port number. Do you remember we removed any from line 45 where we changed var HOME_NET any with var HOME_NET <Host IP>. Because we want this IDS to work specifically to work for host OS.
In the end of rule I have specified the message with "msg:" keyword. The same message will be displayed in the logs and during the packet monitoring also if any such packet following the rule is scanned. With the keyword "sid:", we provide a unique ID to this rule.

Save the file now using ctrl+s.
Run the IDS in CMD using command snort.exe -i 1 -dev -A console -c c:\Snort\etc\snort.conf -l c:\Snort\log -K ascii
Here I have used -i 1 for specifying interface 1, because in Windows 7, interface 1 was active. Use -l c:\Snort\log -K ascii to specify the folder where to keep the logs saved. The option -c is to specify the location of the configuration file, which contains all the variables and the rule file paths. The option -K is to specify the format in which we want to see the output, be it the logs or the runtime monitoring.

It will show some warnings, you can neglect them, but if the error are displayed, you will have to fix them.
It will implement all the rules that we have added to various rule files present in c:\snort\rules folder. If there will be any error in it then it will indicate the line number and the file where the error occurred.
Go to the logs folder c:\snort\logs, it will be currently empty, but as soon as any packet which follow the rules we have mentioned in the rule files, the folder with the name of IP will be created, and in it proper logs will be created. I will be showing it in below steps.

Log folder where the logs of packets complying to the rules mentioned will be logged hereStart the IDS using the above command snort.exe -i 1 -dev -A console -c c:\Snort\etc\snort.conf -l c:\Snort\log -K ascii. I have another machine in the same network, Kali Linux with IP 192.168.248.146

![hack](/assets/CyberForensics/ids26.png)

I will ping from this machine to my Windows 7 machine using command ping 192.168.248.134 command.

Sending ICMP packets with the help of ping command to host where IDS is runningIn the host side, IDS produces such type of output during the monitoring of the packets. Since they follow the rule specified in the rule file of ICMP, they will be logged too.

Red box highlights the IP of Kali Linux & Blue box highlights the message we specified in rule of ICMP rule fileLog folder showing the folder for the particular IP (Kali linux) because it sent ICMP requestsInside the folder of IP address, showing the log file for that particular IP addressNow open this ICMP_ECHO.ids file with the help of notepad, it is containing the logs of the requests made by Kali Linux, sending ICMP ping probes to host machine, which I have flagged as malicious for the host by defining the rules in the rule file.

![hack](/assets/CyberForensics/ids31.png)

You can infer from the above snap of log file, that the IP has sent ICMP ECHO packet, the IP address is present in the log, even the message Bad Ping probes is also mentioned in the logs.
Even the MAC address of the Kali machine has been mentioned in the logs, with the help of TTL:64 present in the logs, you can easily infer that it is a Linux OS. Because TTL(Time To Live) for a packet from a particular OS is always same. Therefore you are able to get lots of information about the device who tried to ping your host machine.

Creating The Rule For HTTP/HTTPS Protocol
In last section I created a rule for ICMP packet. Now I will create the rule for HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol). For this I will start a local apache server with the help of XAMPP, and then create a rule for it that.
Suppose a situation: Packets coming from any IP and from any port, to our host IP at port 80 or 443, then it will be a malicious request, and we have to log it. The rule for it be as follows:
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET 80,443 (msg:"Someone trying to access port 80,443"; sid:1234;)
Since HTTP is a TCP protocol, i.e. it does 3-way handshake for connecting to server, therefore I have used TCP in the protocol part of the rule. Since the rule is for 2 ports specifically of the host, therefore I have added 80,443 destination ports of the hosts in the rule. Similarly the msg: and a unique sid: is also given to the rule.
Save the rule for HTTP in C:\Snort\rules folder and in this folder write this rule in web-attacks.rules file. It's up to you, in which file you want to enter this rule. The filenames provide a better understanding about the rule to the user, rest it doesn't matter in which rule file you are writing which rule.

Save this file using ctrl+s
Start the IDS using the command snort.exe -i 1 -dev -A console -c c:\Snort\etc\snort.conf -l c:\Snort\log -K ascii.
Now I will go to my Kali machine, and open Firefox browser, I will enter the the IP address 192.168.248.134 of the host to connect with the apache server running there, and press the enter key of the keyboard.

Going to access apache server hosted on Windows 7 host machine

Got the dashboard of XAMPP server

Red boundary denotes the IP address of Kali Linux sending TCP packets at port 80 of host to access the web server, blue boundary denotes the alert message

Again go to c:\snort\log\ folder, open the folder with IP address 192.168.248.146 because it contains all the logs related to this IP address. As soon as you will open it, you will now see that a new log file is added to it, TCP_58878–80.ids which contains the log of newly created rule, which got violated by the IP 192.168.248.146. If you run it for longer time then 3–4 more file would be created for the same rule, because the Kali machine keeps on sending various flags of 3-way handshake (SYN,ACK). Open the log file now.

![hack](/assets/CyberForensics/ids38.png)

You can infer from the above snap of log file, that the IP has sent TCP SYN packet, the IP address is present in the log, even the message Someone trying to access port 80,443 is also mentioned in the logs.
Even the MAC address of the Kali machine has been mentioned in the logs, with the help of TTL:64 present in the logs, you can easily infer that it is a Linux OS. Because TTL(Time To Live) for a packet from a particular OS is always same. Therefore you are able to get lots of information about the device who tried to ping your host machine.

If you look closely to the logs then you can see the full 3-way handshake too.

TRY:
reject tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET 80,443 (msg:"Someone trying to access port 80,443"; sid:1234;) as the rule.

and see what's how the server behaves, when it gets the TCP 3-way handshake request.

In this blog I have shown the practical implementation of how the IDS works for monitoring and logging various malicious requests/packets sent by the attacker. I also discussed how we can create various rules for IDS and how to implement them using various files.
